<p align="center"><b><font face="Courier" size="2">PROGRAMMER and DISPLAY</font></b></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">The main schematic of the 
programmer and display I have designed is shown below. Click on the picture for 
a bigger image.</font></p>

<p align="center"><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130503044657/http://neazoi.com/transistorizedcpu/programmer.png">
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130503044657im_/http://neazoi.com/transistorizedcpu/programmer_small.png" border="0" height="810" width="1060"></a></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">To save on gates, I have not 
used buffers to set the address, instruction and data bits, but just inverters. 
I have also found it more convenient to think of a closed switch as bit 1, 
rather than the opposite way round. This does not affect the operation of the 
rest of the computer.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">In programmer version 1, a single inverter, switched on the power 
to a series of 16 transistor gates on the programmer. This transistor set the 
enable wire to either 0.6v (logic 0) or 5v (logic 1). The programmer in that 
version did not worked as expected, as there was probably a fan-out problem. The 
single inverter could not drive 16 gates directly, but a maximum of 3 of them.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">To deal with the problem, I 
produced a second version of the programmer. I disconnected the enable wire from the transistor inverter and I replaced the 
mode multi switch with a stereo one. Each time program mode is selected, by one 
portion of the stereo switch, the other portion connects the 16 gates directly 
to vcc, therefore enabling them. Since there is no electronic connection of this 
enable wire to the rest of the computer, this simple mechanical trick works 
fine.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">The only change in version 3, 
was the addition of inputs to 
support a punch card reader (RD0-RD16). In version 4, a simple modification at the PRG WRITE circuit, 
allowed protection from 
accidentally writing memory when in RESET and RUN mode. When not in PROGRAM 
mode, the output of the circuit is always floating, independent of the WRITE 
button state. This floating output is seen as logic one by the rest of 
the computer. A WRITE pulse indicator is added too, as this was thought to be 
helpful. In version 5, the 3k resistor at the 
WRITE pulse circuit has been removed, to allow for good card reader sensitivity. 
The card reader is now biased only from the base resistors of the WRITE pulse 
circuit. Logic one, will now be represented as a floating input and not as 5v. 
The result is identical. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">The final version is 6. Thanks to
<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130503044657/http://www.northdownfarm.co.uk/rory/tim/tinytim.htm">Rory Mangles</a>, the LED 
driving circuits have been simplified in a single transistor, significantly 
reducing the number of transistors used in the programmer. The drawback with 
this simpler approach is that the LEDs are not completely switched off on zero 
logic but they are very dim. To correct this, I have added a 10k resistor from 
the transistor base to the ground. Now everything works as expected.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">Below, a single inverter and 
how it is soldered on the proto board is shown. I have chosen a way to solder 
the components on the board that would be quick to solder and at the same time, 
consuming less space.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130503044657im_/http://neazoi.com/transistorizedcpu/DSC06206.JPG" border="0" height="573" width="747"></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">All the components and some 
wiring are soldered on the copper side. The rest of the wiring (mainly power 
supply lines), LEDs and pins, is done on the opposite side of the board. I found 
this way faster to solder and debug. Below, three inverters are stacked together 
(power supply lines are not present).</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">The 8-bit address and display 
section has been completed below. The circuit consumes 5V @ about 100mA.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Courier" size="2"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130503044657im_/http://neazoi.com/transistorizedcpu/DSC06217.JPG" border="0" height="504" width="798"></font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">The bit settings are done using 
jumpers which are cheap and small. If a front panel is to be made, these jumpers 
can be very easily replaced by switches, fitted on the male pin rows using 
female pin rows or direct soldering.</font></p>

<p align="center"><b><font face="Courier" size="2">PUNCH CARD READER</font></b></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">If you have written a program 
for the computer, programming it is a fairly easy process. But switching 16 
switches to program just a single row in memory can be very time consuming in 
large programs. Therefore, I have decided to make a punched card reader, which 
allows rapid programming of the computer, within a few seconds. </font></p>
<p align="center"><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130503044657/http://neazoi.com/transistorizedcpu/punchcardreader.png">
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130503044657im_/http://neazoi.com/transistorizedcpu/punchcardreader_small.png" border="0" height="810" width="1060"></a></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">Optical reading is the best 
choice for ensuring reading repeatability. You need 18 IR LEDs and 18 IR 
photo-transistors. 16 of them are for the data, address and instruction. The 
remaining 2 are for the WRITE pulse and the card auto detection. Try to find the 
smallest packages, in order to reduce the total card size, but do not solder 
them too close, as the IR light might affect adjacent sensors. I have left a 
one-hole space between most of the adjacent sensors in my reader, to ensure this.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">Since the photo-transistors are 
connected in parallel with the programmer switches, you have to ensure that 
before inserting a card in the reader, all the programmer switches must be open 
(i.e. not connected to ground). This has to be done manually.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">You also have to ensure that 
the reader won't interfere with the manual switches programming, when there is 
not card in it. For that purpose, the reader uses a mechanism to auto detect if 
a card has been inserted. The reader will enable itself as a programmer input, 
only when a punch card has been inserted into it. This is accomplished by a 
separate sensor that is mounted below others (right-bottom in the next picture), 
which enables the rest of the sensors, only after a card has been slipped 
through. Since the position of this sensor is below others (assuming the card 
slips-in from top to the bottom in the next picture), it will ensure that a card 
will be always present in the position of the rest of the sensors when they are 
enabled, therefore avoiding random data writing in memory positions. Also, you 
have to detect when the card has been slipped-out completely, in order to 
disable the reader again. The same detection mechanism is used like before, to 
accomplish this and a small cut on the card ensures this (more on this at the 
template card section).</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130503044657im_/http://neazoi.com/transistorizedcpu/DSC06469.png" border="0" height="305" width="748"></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">As far as concern the 
mechanical construction, the same prototype board material is used to make the 
punched card reader. This is a good choice as it is cheap an the holes have 
already been drilled and perfectly aligned. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">You need to make the sensors/LEDs 
holes a bit larger, depending on the diameter of the ones you have available. 
The important bit, is to make the write-pulse hole quite smaller than the rest 
of the holes. This will ensure that all the other sensors will be set, when the 
write pulse is created. In my prototype, I left the proto-board hole as wide as 
it was, for the write-pulse sensor.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">All sensors are mounted on the 
solder side of the proto-board, facing towards the non-solder side. If the 
sensors are quite small (smd sized), the holes of the board will act themselves 
like a small tube-like construction for each sensor, which further ensures 
no-interference from adjacent sensors.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130503044657im_/http://neazoi.com/transistorizedcpu/DSC06470.png" border="0" height="306" width="747"></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">Two proto boards are needed to 
make the punch card reader. The first, contains the IR LEDs and the second, the 
IR photo-transistors. These are sandwiched like shown in the next photo, with 
the sensors soldered on the solder sides (outwards) and faced towards the inner 
sides. Two small pieces of the same material, are inserted on both ends, to 
create the necessary spacing for the punch card that slips in and at the same 
time to ensure correct alignment of the punch card. In fact, a little more 
spacing is needed, to compensate for the punch card solder hole filling (filling 
the holes of a single sided proto card with solder, will create a small solder 
ball onto each hole) and this spacing is done by adding one washer on top of the 
spacing board pieces. The whole construction is 
held together firmly, using four small screws.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130503044657im_/http://neazoi.com/transistorizedcpu/DSC06471.png" border="0" height="177" width="971"></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">Making the punch card reader 
like this, ensures correct alignment of the punch card that slips-in. 
Slipping-in the punch card is not quite smooth and it usually requires more 
force. Nevertheless, this fact, minimizes the unwanted case of accidentally 
slipping the card backwards. Even if you have left a punch card inside the 
reader and you turn it upside down, the card won't slip-out backwards.</font></p>

<p align="center"><b><font face="Courier" size="2">Punch card template</font></b></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">In order to ensure that the 
reader will only de enabled when there is a card slipped in and it will be 
disabled when the card is not present and at the same time to prevent accidental 
bits writing, the punch card template shown below must be made for each of your 
programs. Please click on the picture to see a description of the different 
areas on the punch card.</font></p>

<p align="center"><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130503044657/http://neazoi.com/transistorizedcpu/DSC06567.JPG">
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130503044657im_/http://neazoi.com/transistorizedcpu/DSC06567_small.jpg" border="0" height="583" width="778"></a></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">Using this card template, there 
is also the advantage that if a bigger program needs to be written you may split 
it in more than one cards and insert them in sequence.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">With the existing reader 
configuration mentioned above, the write pulse holes on the punch card had to be 
made a little bit bigger to ensure correct operation. Correct operation means 
that the WRITE pulse will only occur after all bits are set and also that the 
WRITE pulse will be disabled before any of the bits is un-set. You may have to 
do some tweaking on the hole sizes of your proto-board, to ensure this. </font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">Another problem that I faced 
was with the proto-board I had available. It was quite transparent, so the IR 
light could pass through it, so that the card-detect sensor did not have the 
correct behavior. I corrected this by having the card-detect area painted. If 
your proto-board is not transparent you do not need to paint it.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">By clicking on the picture 
above, you can see the different areas on the punch card. Info section 1 and 2 
contain information read by the human not the computer, since the WRITE pulse is 
disabled then. Info section 1 contains the card description (TESTCARD in this 
example) and info section 2 contains the card number (1/1 in this example). I 
found it very useful to create letters on the punch card, since these areas were 
used already for other purposes, but they could not be used for real computer 
data. The tree first and the three last WRITE pulses must be disabled for 
correct operation. This allows the card to be detected before a WRITE pulse 
comes and the reader to be disabled when there is no card in it. The little cut 
on the card detect must be done as well, to ensure that the reader will be 
disabled when there is no card in it. At the actual data area of the punch card, 
whenever there is a hole, it is a bit 1 and whenever there is a filled hole, it 
is a bit 0.</font></p>

<p align="center"><b><font face="Courier" size="2">INPUT / OUTPUT</font></b></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">The main schematic of the 
input/output I have designed is shown below. Click on the picture for 
a bigger image.</font></p>

<p align="center"><a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130503044657/http://neazoi.com/transistorizedcpu/inputoutput.png">
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20130503044657im_/http://neazoi.com/transistorizedcpu/inputoutput_small.png" border="0" height="810" width="1060"></a></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">I have added monitoring of the 
inputs and outputs because I found this feature to be as useful as monitoring 
the internals of the CPU. The positive edge triggered flip-flop is shown at the 
top of the schematic and the I/O monitoring at the right. I have not used buffer 
gates on the output portion because it is not needed, as the drive capability of 
the flip-flop output gates is equal to that of the buffers.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">For the input, buffers must be 
used though. The input buffers are shown at the left bottom of the schematic. 
The new feature introduced here, is the enable. Complement PNP transistors are 
used, in a configuration that allows a floating output when the gates are not 
enabled (output not connected to GND or VCC) and a zero or floating/one output, 
when the gates are enabled, depended on the input bits.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">A floating output behaves like 
a disconnected wire. Thus, when the buffer is disabled and the flip-flop is 
enabled (output mode), the data inputs of the flip-flop will not be affected by 
any buffer inputs. Also, the outputs of the buffers will not be affected by the 
data bus, because both the bases and the collectors of the  buffers are 
disconnected from the 5V. I could have used only one PNP transistor to enable 
all buffers but I have found that it cannot drive more than 2-3 gates in that 
configuration.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">In the case that the buffer is 
enabled and the flip-flop is reset (input mode), a floating buffer output that 
behaves like a disconnected wire, will be seen as input-set-1 at the input diode 
of the next stage (input set to 5V and floating input mean the same thing, since 
the computer is made out of the same kind of gates). In that case, I am not 
really sure if a SET output will be floating or 1. Either case, the next stages 
will "sense" both of them as 1.</font></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">Version 2 of the input/output 
design has a more simplified LED display section.</font></p><hr>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Courier" size="2">Front panel</font></b></p>
<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">After making the programmer and 
the punch card reader, things have been started to get a bit messy, as there 
were a lot of wires coming out of the programmer. To ensure rigidity and 
usability, I have decided to build a front panel for the computer and tie the 
boards on it.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">The front panel is made out of 
a single piece of aluminum sheet. Holes have been drilled for the display LEDs 
and the jumper switches and also to support the programmer board underneath. The 
punch card reader is mounted on the front in order to be accessible and it's 
cables pass through a hole to the programmer.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><font face="Courier" size="2">The jumper switches holes have 
to be made a little bit larger, to allow your finger to set up the jumpers. Some 
extra holes have been made as well, in order to support the I/O board LEDs later 
on. The lettering is done using a punch letter kit. This ensures the letters 
will never fade out throughout the years.</font></p>
