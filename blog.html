    <h1>My blog (updated when I remember to)</h1> 
    <h2> 28/6/25: What am I doing? </h2>
    <p> I'm back once more, and feel worse. Lately I have lost all my motivation to do not just my hobbies, but just anything in general. This has lead me to feel: miserable, annoying, pissed, useless, and other negative feelings. I don't want to do anything anymore, and I Fell as if life isn't worth living. On top of all of alll that, my life feels like it's falling apart, because A: my mother and step father want to move to perth , which means I'll have to cut off all the connectins I have made here, and I'll rarely see my father, who I feel is my only escape from my mother. B: I feel people at my highschool are becoming more distant with me, and hate me/ find me extremely annoying. I haven't made any progess in the more than a month since I have last blogged. See ya. <p>
    <h2> 10/5/25: Where have I been? </h2>
    <p> After I went on "Hiatus" I took my own time when working on projects so I didn't feel pressured to post an update on github. In that time I have also taken small breaks just to enjoy life more and understand that I shouldn't program my entire childhood. I will post updates on github to my OS and other projects when I feel like it from now on. but for now you can rest knowing what I have been doing with my time  </p>
